This is a fork of Arest's Home Assistant app that provides a CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) print server, allowing you to manage and share printers over your local network. It's designed for Home Assistant users who want to integrate network printing capabilities directly into their smart home setup. It includes the foo2hbpl2 printer drivers and has been optimised to support Android printing and home assistant S6 overlay.

## Features

- **Network Printing**: Share printers across your local network using CUPS
- **Web Interface**: Access the CUPS administration panel at `http://<your-ha-ip>:631` to add and manage printers
- **Secure Administration**: Optional authentication for the CUPS admin interface
- **Printer Support**: Compatible with a wide range of network and USB printers
- **Lightweight**: Built on Alpine Linux for minimal resource usage
- **Data Persistence**: Printer settings and configurations persist across restarts and updates

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fesbnetworking%2FFuji_Xerox-cups-addon)

### From Home Assistant App Store

1. Navigate to your Home Assistant instance.
2. Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **Install App**.
3. Click the 3-dot menu in the top right corner and select **Repositories**.
4. Add `https://github.com/esbnetworking/Fuji_Xerox-cups-addon` as a repository.
5. Find the "CUPS Print Server" app in the store and click it.
6. Click **Install**.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to manually install:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/esbnetworking/Fuji_Xerox-cups-addon.git
   ```

2. Copy the repository to your Home Assistant add-ons directory:
   ```bash
   scp -r cups-addon/cups root@<your-ha-ip>:/addons/
   ```

3. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **Install App**.
4. Click the 3-dot menu (top right) → **Repositories**.
5. Add `/addons` as a repository URL and click **Add**.
6. Refresh the app store to see "CUPS Print Server."
7. Install the app.

## Configuration

The app provides the following configuration options:

```yaml
admin_username: printadmin
admin_password: your_secure_password
```

- **admin_username**: Username for the CUPS admin interface (default: printadmin)
- **admin_password**: Password for the CUPS admin interface

After configuring:

1. Start the app from the Info tab.
2. Check the Log tab to ensure it starts successfully.
3. Access the CUPS web interface at `http://<your-ha-ip>:631`.

## Usage

### Access the Web Interface

Visit `http://<your-ha-ip>:631` in your browser.

### Add a Printer

1. Go to the **Administration** tab.
2. Click **Add Printer** and follow the prompts.
3. Select the appropriate driver for your printer model.

### Print from Devices

Shared printers are advertised on the LAN via AirPrint/Bonjour (Avahi). On
iPhone, iPad, and Mac they should appear as nearby printers. Do not pick the
printer's own LPD advertisement (for example "Canon MG5200 series") — that
bypasses this server.

To add the CUPS queue manually on macOS:

1. System Settings → Printers & Scanners → Add Printer → **IP**
2. Address: `<your-ha-hostname>` (e.g. `homeassistant.local`)
3. Protocol: **IPP**
4. Queue: `printers/<queue-name>`
5. Use: **Auto Select**

You can also print to `ipp://<your-ha-ip>:631/printers/<queue-name>`.

## Supported Printer Types

This app supports various printer types:

- Network printers (via IPP, LPD, etc.)
- USB printers connected to your Home Assistant host
- Shared Windows printers (via Samba)
- AirPrint for Apple devices

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Web Interface

- Ensure the app is running (check logs).
- Verify port 631 isn't blocked by your firewall.
- Check that your network allows access to the Home Assistant device.

### Printer Not Detected

- Ensure the printer is network-accessible or connected via USB to the host.
- For USB printers, you may need to configure USB device pass-through to the app.
- Check CUPS logs in the app's Log tab.


### Printer Drivers

Gutenprint CUPS drivers (Canon, HP, Brother, and many others) are bundled via
the Alpine `gutenprint-cups` package. In the add-printer list, models often
appear as a series name (for example Canon PIXMA MG5250 is **Canon MG5200
series - CUPS+Gutenprint**).

For printers Gutenprint does not cover, supply a `.deb` through
`printer_driver_deb` (place the file in `/share`) or use a PPD from:

- https://www.openprinting.org/download/PPD/
- https://www.openprinting.org/drivers/

### Authentication Issues

- Verify you're using the correct username and password configured in the app settings.
- If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by reconfiguring the app.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add your feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.

### Running the checks locally

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) validates the add-on
metadata, lints the init scripts, then builds and smoke-tests the image. Run the
same checks before opening a PR:

```bash
# Add-on metadata: required keys, known arch values, options/schema and
# ports/description symmetry, version vs CHANGELOG, slug vs directory name
pip install pyyaml
python3 .github/scripts/validate_addon.py

# Init scripts
bash -n cups/rootfs/etc/cont-init.d/*
shellcheck --severity=error -s bash cups/rootfs/etc/cont-init.d/*

# Build and smoke test
docker build -t cups-addon:ci cups/
.github/scripts/smoke_test.sh cups-addon:ci
```

The smoke test boots the image the way the Supervisor does and checks that cupsd
comes up, that the compiled filters (`rastertokpsl`, `raster2dymolw`/`m`) and
vendored PPDs are present, that avahi is advertising for AirPrint, that the
`cupsd.conf` access policy still covers the LAN ranges, and that a LAN client can
reach the web UI.

Any change to `cups/config.yaml` must bump `version` to match the newest
`## [x.y.z]` heading in `CHANGELOG.md` — CI enforces this.

## Data Persistence

This app stores all CUPS data in the Home Assistant `/share` directory, ensuring:

- Printer configurations persist across app restarts
- Print jobs and settings are maintained through system reboots
- App updates won't cause loss of printer configurations
- All CUPS data is included in Home Assistant backups

The following directories are maintained in the persistent storage:
- `/share/cups/config`: CUPS configuration files
- `/share/cups/cache`: CUPS cache data
- `/share/cups/logs`: CUPS log files
- `/share/cups/state`: CUPS state information
